👋 Hi, I’m @Chandra-Sekhar-9490
👀 I’m interested in becoming a Web developer and enhancing my full-stack web development skills.
🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js alongside improving my existing skills in React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Sass.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, particularly those that involve front-end optimization, full-stack solutions, or learning and implementing modern JavaScript frameworks.
📫 How to reach me: (Consider adding your preferred contact method or social links here, if applicable).
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I have a solid foundation in front-end development, but I’m excited to expand my horizons into full-stack development, particularly with back-end technologies.
